Template repsitory for creating a deployable NPM package

## Getting Started

Guide for getting this template repository set up for usage with your own NPM package

### Repo Setup

1. Use this template repository to create a new repository
1. Clone the new repository to your machine
1. Update the name of the package in `package.json` to reflect the name you would like for your library
1. Run `npm install` in the terminal, this will:
    - Install all necessary dependencies
    - Set up Husky hooks to validate commit messages

Once the below steps have been completed, you should be able to run the release workflow and deploy your package to NPM successfully

#### Create NPM Token

In order for the release step to run successfully, you must create a token in NPM that will
allow you to publish the package as part of your release pipeline.

1. If you haven't already, create an [NPM account](https://www.npmjs.com/signup)
1. Ensure that 2FA is only required for authentication
1. Create a new `Automation` access token and copy the value of the token
1. Create a new Actions secret in your repo named `NPM_TOKEN` that contains the token you copied from NPM

#### GitHub Configuration

There are a number of configurations within your GitHub project that are needed to help facilitate the secure release of your package

##### Public Repositories

With a public reposoitory, there is the possibility that you could have unexpected contributors making changes to your project.
Therefore, there are a number of things that you can configure within the project to help keep your package secure and protected:

- **Branch Protections** - You should enable branch protections on your `main` branch to ensure that users cannot push directly to the branch triggering a release
- **Environment Configuration** - You can configure an environment for your project to help restrict a workflow to only run under certain conditions (branch = `main)
- **Semantic Release Updates** - With branch protections enabled, semantic-release will be unable to push updates to your main branch by default, there are two options for this
  - Have semantic-release push updates to a branch which you can then merge into main after the pipeline has completed successfully
  - Create a personal access token with admin rights to your project and add the token as a secret in your environment configuration, preventing that token from being used in other workflows

You can also choose to not turn on additional protections, which will prevent semantic-release from having issues with pushing updates as part of the release process,
but that is not recommended as it leaves you open to malicious users.

##### Private Repositories

With private repositories, there is less risk of unexpected users making changes as all contributors have to be explicitly defined.
That being said, adding protections defined in the `Public Repositories` section will help increase the security of your repository.

#### Additional Configuration Updates (optional)

1. Build configuration using the `tsconfig.*.json` files
    - `tsconfig.json` - General build configuration (rules, files, etc)
    - `config/tsconfig.cjs.json` - Configuration for building package for CommonJS modules
    - `config/tsconfig.esm.json` - Configuration for building package for ECMAScript modules
1. ESLint configuration using the `config/.eslintrc` file
1. Unit test configuration
    - Update `config/.mocharc.json` to update configuration for Mocha
    - Remove `config/.mochrc.json` and configure another testing framework
1. Release configuration using `release.config.js`
1. Commitlint configuration (used for validating commit messages) using `config/commitlint.config.js`
1. [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) configuration

### Defining Contributions

Use the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file to define how contributions to your project should be made.

This file should include:

- Instructions for setting up the project locally
- Expectations for development practices while updating the codebase
- Expectations for issues and pull requests created within the project

### Commit Message Formatting

`semantic-release` uses commit messages to determine if a release is necessary when the pipeline is run.
Therefore, the commit messages need to have a specific structure so that the release process can determine if a new release is required.

The formatting of the commit must follow:

```text
<type>(optional scope): summary
```

#### **Type**

Used to determine if a release is necessary, must be one of the following values:

| Type | Description | Release |
|:----:|:-----------:|:-------:|
|**build**|Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies|No Release|
|**chore**|Automated changes to project|No Release|
|**ci**|Changes to CI configuration files and scripts|No Release|
|**docs**|Changes to documentation|No Release|
|**feat**|Implementation of a new feature|Minor/Feature Release|
|**fix**|Changes that fix bugs|Patch/Fix Release|
|**perf**|Changes to improve performance|Major/Breaking Release|
|**refactor**|Code change that does not fix a bug or add a feature|No Release|
|**test**|Adding or updating tests|No Release|

> *[Updates](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#commit-message-format) can be made to what types trigger releases in `release.config.js`*

#### **Scope** (optional)

Name of the component affected

#### **Summary**
